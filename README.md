### Task List
    In Sheet 1, enter sales data. You can extend this dataset with additional columns or rows to include more information or make it more comprehensive based on the specific tasks you want to perform. Sample data set here. 
    Order ID: Unique identifier for each order.
    Product: The product being sold.
    Quantity: Quantity of the product in the order.
    Unit Price: The price per unit of the product.
    Customer Name: The name of the customer making the purchase.
    Date: The date of the sale.
    Apply basic formatting to the total cell. (text formatting, cell background, number formatting, alignment, etc.) 
    Simple Functions and Formulas: Use basic functions like SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, and MAX for simple data calculations.
    Sorting and Filtering: Create filter views to show specific subsets of information. The filter views must appear under Data.
    Charts and Graphs: Create a basic chart (bar, pie, or line) to visually represent data for enhanced data understanding.

    Advanced Function Proficiency: Using the same or enhanced data set from the Basic Level Tasks, use XLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, and IF statements to retrieve specific information from the sales dataset.
    Data Validation Mastery: 
    Apply data validation rules to ensure that quantities and unit prices entered adhere to specific criteria.
    Create a drop-down list for the "Product" column to ensure consistency in data entry.
    Pivot Table Expertise Create a pivot table to summarize the total sales for each product.
    Conditional Functions Proficiency: Use SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, and AVERAGEIFS to calculate total sales, average price, and quantity based on specific criteria (e.g., product and date).
    Sheet and Data Protection: Protect the "Date" column to prevent accidental edits, ensuring data accuracy.

    Advanced Data Analysis: Using the original data set as a foundation, utilize the ARRAYFORMULA and TRANSPOSE functions to efficiently process data in the provided dataset.
    Data Visualization: Create a dynamic and interactive dashboard in Google Sheets using advanced charts (e.g., scatter, radar) and graphs based on the provided dataset.
    Advanced Pivot Tables: Develop a multi-level pivot table in Google Sheets using the provided sales dataset, incorporating calculated fields and calculated items.
    Importing and Exporting Automation: Utilize Google Apps Script to automate the process of importing and exporting data, ensuring seamless data updates and retrieval from external sources.
    Custom Add-ons: Build a custom add-on for Google Sheets using Google Apps Script to enhance productivity and extend functionality based on specific needs related to the provided dataset.
    Advanced Query Language: Demonstrate expertise in using complex and nested queries with the QUERY function for sophisticated data analysis using the provided dataset.
    Data Validation with Scripts: Use Google Apps Script to create custom data validation rules based on the provided dataset.
    Advanced Data Cleaning: Demonstrate proficiency in using regular expressions (REGEX) for advanced text cleaning and manipulation on the provided dataset.
    Interactive Forms Integration: Integrate Google Forms with Google Sheets, automatically populating data into the sheet upon form submissions for real-time data collection.
    Error Handling and Debugging: Showcase the ability to identify and troubleshoot errors in complex formulas, scripts, or custom functions related to the provided dataset.
